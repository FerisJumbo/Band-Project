          <h3>Information</h3>
          <p>
            <i>Machu Pichu, "City in the Sky"</i> was composed by
            <strong>Satoshi Yagisawa</strong> in 2005 and has a running duration
            of 10:30 featuring more than 40 different parts!
          </p>
          <p>
            As the song states in the title, it is about Machu Picchu, but was
            written in remeberance of the Incan Empire and Spanish
            conquistadors. During this time period, Andean South America was
            home to the Incan capital called,
            <i>The Golden City of Cuzco.</i> When the Spanish conquistadors
            visted the Incan Empire, they stripped the city of their gold and
            destroyed Cuzco's Sun Temple, which was built on the founding
            religion of the empire.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was Yagisawa's inspiration for composing the piece as he wanted
            to musically describe what the Incan Empire had built and to unravel
            the mysterious new world. Throughout the song you can hear 3
            concepts about Machu Picchu's past.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              The shimmering golden city of Cuzco set in the scenery of the
              Andes.
            </li>
            <li>The destructiveness of the Spanish invasion.</li>
            <li>
              the re-emergence of Incan glory as the City in the Sky again
              reached for the sun.
            </li>
          </ol>
